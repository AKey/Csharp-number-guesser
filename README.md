# Csharp-number-guesser
POC project to establish C#/.NET tool chain and git working.  

This is a simple console 'application' that takes user input with simple type validation, does some random number generation and variable comparison, and uses some simple Console attributes like `ForegroundColor` for flair... or really just to play with them.  


## Structure
The application is very simple, encompassing a single namespace which itself contains a single class. Flow is broken into a few simple functions to keep things DRY. There is no external database or any other file access nor validation of any sort.
